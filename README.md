# Data Analyst Supermarket
Analyzing customer spending patterns, item popularity, and trends using supermarket transaction data.

## Type of Project: Data Analysis
This project is an example of exploratory data analysis. For this project, I focused on a supermarket dataset containing information about customer transactions.

## Repository Structure:

### Data: 
The "data" folder within the repository contains the dataset used for this analysis. It includes records of customer transactions, each with various attributes like date, time, items purchased, and expenses.

### Notebooks: 
The "notebooks" folder contains Jupyter Notebook files detailing the step-by-step process of ETL. It begins with data loading and preprocessing and progresses through data exploration and visualization.

### Visualizations: 
In the "visualizations" folder, you will find the visual outputs generated during the analysis using PowerBI.

## Customer Spending Patterns: Key Visualizations
Explore key visualizations shedding light on customer spending patterns in the supermarket:

**Total Expenses Over Time:** A line chart depicting the variation in total expenses over different time periods. This visualization, despite lacking specific purchase dates, can still offer insights into trends.

**Item Categories vs. Expenses:** A bar plot showcasing expense distribution across various item categories. This glimpse into popular product categories helps identify customer preferences.

**Customer Purchase Frequency:** A histogram displaying purchase frequency, offering an overview of customer loyalty and average time gaps between visits.

**Basket Analysis:** A heatmap illustrating correlations between items frequently purchased together, aiding in optimizing product placements and cross-selling strategies.

**Conclusion:**
Despite the limitation of missing purchase dates, this project demonstrates the power of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in understanding customer expenses. Our Jupyter Notebook incorporates various graphics alongside PowerBI visualizations to provide actionable insights for sales enhancement, improved customer experiences, and overall business strategies.
