# Data Analyst Supermarket
Analyzing customer spending patterns, item popularity, and trends using supermarket transaction data.

## Type of Project: Data Analysis
This project is an example of exploratory data analysis. For this project, I focused on a supermarket dataset containing information about customer transactions.

## Repository Structure:

### Data: 
The "data" folder within the repository contains the dataset used for this analysis. It includes records of customer transactions, each with various attributes like date, time, items purchased, and expenses.

### Notebooks: 
The "notebooks" folder contains Jupyter Notebook files detailing the step-by-step process of ETL. It begins with data loading and preprocessing and progresses through data exploration and visualization.

### Visualizations: 
In the "visualizations" folder, you will find the visual outputs generated during the analysis using PowerBI.

## Customer Spending Patterns: Key Visualizations
Visualizations of customer spending patterns in the supermarket:


**Item Categories vs. Expenses:** Expense distribution across various item categories. This glimpse into popular product categories helps identify customer preferences.


**Basket Analysis:** A heatmap illustrating correlations between items frequently purchased together, aiding in optimizing product placements and cross-selling strategies.

**Conclusion:**
The Jupyter Notebook incorporates various graphics alongside PowerBI visualizations to provide insights for sales enhancement, improved customer experiences, and overall business strategies.
